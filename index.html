  <p>Simon is a classic memory and pattern recognition game that challenges players to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colored lights and sounds. The game consists of four colored buttons, each corresponding to a unique tone. Simon generates a sequence, and players must replicate it by pressing the buttons in the correct order. With each successful repetition, the sequence grows longer, testing and enhancing the player's memory skills. The objective is to see how long players can remember and accurately reproduce the ever-expanding patterns, providing an entertaining and stimulating experience.</p>
